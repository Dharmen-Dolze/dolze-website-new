                    <h2>Data Security</h2>
                    <p>At DolzeAI Technologies Pvt Ltd, we understand that your data security is paramount. This document outlines our comprehensive approach to protecting your information, maintaining system integrity, and ensuring compliance with international security standards. We are committed to implementing industry-leading security measures to safeguard your data at every stage.</p>

                    <h4 class="mt-5">1. Security Infrastructure</h4>
                    <p>Our security infrastructure is built on multiple layers of protection. We utilize enterprise-grade cloud hosting with 99.9% uptime guarantee to ensure your data is always accessible. Our multi-region data centers provide automatic failover capabilities, ensuring business continuity even during regional outages. Advanced firewalls and intrusion detection systems protect against external threats, while real-time threat monitoring and response systems enable immediate action against security incidents. We conduct regular security audits and penetration testing to identify and address potential vulnerabilities before they can be exploited.</p>

                    <h4 class="mt-5">2. Data Encryption</h4>
                    <p>We implement comprehensive encryption protocols to protect your data at every stage. All data in transit is encrypted using TLS 1.3 during transmission, ensuring secure communication between your devices and our servers. Data stored in our databases is encrypted using AES-256 encryption, providing military-grade protection for your information at rest. Our API security is enhanced with OAuth 2.0 and JWT tokens, ensuring secure authentication and authorization for all API communications. Additionally, all backups are encrypted before storage and transmission, maintaining the same level of security for your data throughout the backup process.</p>

                    <h4 class="mt-5">3. Access Controls and Authentication</h4>
                    <p>We maintain strict access controls to ensure only authorized personnel can access your data. Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is required for all user accounts, adding an extra layer of security beyond traditional passwords. Our role-based access control (RBAC) system implements the principle of least privilege, ensuring users only have access to the specific resources they need to perform their tasks. We conduct regular access reviews and privilege audits to identify and remove unnecessary permissions. Session management includes automatic timeout and logout features to prevent unauthorized access from inactive sessions. Additionally, we enforce secure password policies with complexity requirements to ensure strong authentication credentials.</p>

                    <h4 class="mt-5">4. Data Processing and Storage</h4>
                    <p>Your data is processed and stored with the highest security standards. All data processing occurs within secure, isolated environments that prevent unauthorized access and cross-contamination between different user datasets. We ensure that no sensitive data is stored in log files or temporary storage, minimizing the risk of data exposure. Our automatic data sanitization and secure deletion protocols ensure that data is properly cleaned and permanently removed when no longer needed. We perform regular data integrity checks and validation to maintain the accuracy and consistency of your information. Additionally, we maintain compliance with data residency requirements, ensuring your data is stored in accordance with applicable regulations and your preferences.</p>

                    <h4 class="mt-5">5. AI and Machine Learning Security</h4>
                    <p>Our AI systems are designed with security in mind from the ground up. AI models are trained in isolated, secure environments that prevent unauthorized access and ensure data privacy during the training process. We maintain a strict policy that no user data is used to train third-party AI models, protecting your information from being shared with external parties. All AI interactions undergo thorough input validation and sanitization to prevent malicious inputs and ensure system integrity. Our secure model deployment process includes version control to track changes and maintain accountability. We conduct regular AI model security assessments to identify potential vulnerabilities and ensure our AI systems remain secure and trustworthy.</p>
